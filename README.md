## Mars Rover Kata

Kata instructions and requirements may be found [here](https://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata)

### Assumptions

Currently my assumption is that there is a 2D cartesian coordinate system
with the origin (O) at the centre (0, 0). North corresponds to the positive
y-axis and east to the positive x-axis. Of course South corresponds to the
negative y-axis and west the negative x-axis.

Here, I appealed to the idea of the rover having coordinates and the instructions
correspond to coordinate transformations in geometry,
namely, [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry)).
